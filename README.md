## Organization of this repository

### How to add new findings?

1. Please create a new directory in this repository.
2. Create a README.md document in that directory.
3. Make sure your README.md contains a clear description of what the outcome is
   from your research topic: ideally propose what the next steps should be.
   It's completely fine to tell that the technology is not interesting to us
   and there are no further actions.
4. Add everything related to your topic in the directory.
5. Open a pull request.
