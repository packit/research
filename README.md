## Organization of this repository

### How to add new findings?

1. Please create a new directory in this repository.
2. Create a README.md document in that directory.
3. Make sure your README.md contains a clear description of what the outcome is
   from your research topic: ideally propose what the next steps should be.
   It's completely fine to tell that the technology is not interesting to us
   and there are no further actions.
